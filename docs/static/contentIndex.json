It is not news that the next 1905 will be somewhere between 2025 and 2030, where people will discover AGI. The big difference here is that AGI will not be discovered as a breakthrough but as a result of gradual improvements in the current AI systems.\nAs our AI systems develop, they will be the ones who create the breakthroughs and transform our lives. But there is one arena where AI is not contemplated very much, yet plays a big role in the creation and development of modern AI systems. The arena I am talking about is Neuroscience.\nOur body is a product of millions of years of evolution, and one of the most awesome products of evolution is the human brain. Think about it for a minute: our brain works at extremely low power, learns new concepts pretty fast, stores a whole lot of information, runs the whole body, and weighs only 1.4 kilograms. Even though all the modern AI systems are very much motivated by the brain, we are still scratching the surface.\nIf you are someone who wants to learn more about how the brain works and what we know about the mathematics of the brain, then this blog is for you.\nBiological Neural Networks: A Computational Paradigm\nAt the core of neuroscience-inspired artificial intelligence lies the intricate structure of biological neural networks.\nIf your brain had a twitter bio, its would read “Multi-tasking Expert, Parallel Processing Ninja, and Professional Signal Interpreter”.\nA biological neuron is not a simple binary switch, but a complex computational unit characterized by following features\n\n\nStructural Complexity\n\nDendritic arbor: A branching network of input receivers\nSoma: The cell body that integrates multiple input signals\nAxon: The signal transmission pathway\nSynaptic terminals: Points of inter neuronal communication\n\n\n\nSignal Processing Mechanisms\n\nMembrane Potential Dynamics: Neurons process information through graded electrical potentials\nThreshold based Activation: Action potentials are generated when membrane potential exceeds a critical threshold\nSpike timing dependent Plasticity (STDP): A learning mechanism where the timing of neuronal spikes determines synaptic weight modifications\n\n\n\nComputational Neural Network Architectures\nArtificial Neuron Model: Mathematical Formalization\nThe artificial neuron, inspired by biological counterparts, can be represented mathematically:\ny = f\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i + b\\right)\nWhere:\n\ny: Output of the neuron\nx_i: Input signals\nw_i: Synaptic weights\nb: Bias term\nf(): Activation function (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid, tanh)\n\nKey Neural Network Paradigms\n\n\nFeedforward Neural Networks\n\nUnidirectional information flow\nTypically used for classification and regression tasks\nLack recurrent connections found in biological systems\n\n\n\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)\n\nIncorporate feedback loops\nMaintain internal state (memory)\nArchitectures like LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) more closely mimic neuronal temporal dynamics\n\n\n\nSpiking Neural Networks (SNNs)\n\nMost biologically faithful neural network model\nDiscrete event based computation\nUse spike timing based information processing\nComputational model closer to biological neural networks\n\n\n\nYou can learn about all these by simply googling or asking your AI Chatbot.\nAdvanced Neuromorphic Principles\nNeuroplasticity Algorithms\nBiological learning is fundamentally about synaptic weight modification.

My journey into neuroscience and psychology has been nothing short of a mind-bending adventure—quite literally! (And yes, that pun was absolutely intended. Neuroscience humor is a rare breed, but I’m determined to make it a thing.)\nThe Incredible Landscape of the Brain\nThe human brain is arguably the most fascinating organ in the body. Weighing just about three pounds, this gelatinous mass of approximately 86 billion neurons is responsible for everything that makes us, well, us. From our most profound philosophical thoughts to our ability to appreciate a perfectly timed dad joke, the brain is the ultimate maestro conducting the orchestra of human experience.\nMy fascination began during when I learned about the basics of neuroscience. There’s something almost magical about seeing the intricate web of connections that allow us to think, feel, remember, and dream. Neurons communicate through electrical and chemical signals, creating complex networks that can process information at speeds that would make the most advanced supercomputers look like pocket calculators.\n(If you ever want to make small talk at a party feel simultaneously impressive and awkward, casually mention that your brain generates enough electricity to power a small LED light. Nothing says “I’m fun at gatherings” quite like turning yourself into a human battery analogy!)\nThe Dance of Neuroscience and Psychology\nWhat truly fascinates me is the intricate dance between neuroscience and psychology. While neuroscience explores the physical structures and mechanisms of the brain, psychology delves into the behavioral and mental processes that emerge from these biological foundations. These complex dynamic systems are the nuts and bolts of thinking and feeling.\nNeuroplasticity: The Brain’s Superpower\nOne of the most revolutionary discoveries in recent decades is neuroplasticity that is the brain’s ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. This means our brains are not fixed structures but dynamic, adaptable systems. Every experience, every learned skill, every memory physically changes the structure of our brain. Read that again: your experiences literally reshape your brain’s architecture.\nThis discovery has profound implications for learning, recovery from brain injuries, and understanding mental health. It challenges the old notion that we’re stuck with the brain we’re born with. Instead, we’re constantly evolving, constantly learning, constantly becoming.\nThe Emotional Brain\nEmotions aren’t just abstract experiences—they’re complex neurochemical responses carefully choreographed by different brain regions. The limbic system, often called the “emotional brain,” includes structures like the amygdala, which plays a crucial role in processing emotions, particularly fear and anxiety.\nBut here’s where it gets really interesting: our emotional responses are not just reflexive reactions but can be modulated by higher-order cognitive processes. This means we have more control over our emotional states than we often realize. Through techniques like mindfulness, cognitive-behavioral strategies, and emotional regulation, we can actually train our brains to respond more effectively to emotional stimuli.\nMental Health: A Holistic Perspective\nAs someone deeply invested in understanding the human mind, I’ve come to see mental health not as a binary state of “healthy” or “unhealthy,” but as a complex, dynamic spectrum. Neuroscience has shown us that mental health conditions are not character flaws or signs of weakness, but complex interactions between genetic predispositions, environmental factors, and neurochemical processes.\nDepression, anxiety, and other mental health challenges are now understood as treatable conditions involving specific neural pathways and neurotransmitter imbalances. This understanding reduces stigma and opens up more compassionate, effective treatment approaches.\nThe Frontier of Consciousness\nPerhaps the most profound mystery in neuroscience is consciousness itself. How do these electrical signals and chemical interactions give rise to subjective experience? How does the objective become subjective? Despite significant advances, we’re still at the beginning of understanding this fundamental question.\nCurrent theories range from integrated information theory to quantum consciousness models, each offering fascinating perspectives but none providing a definitive answer. It’s humbling to realize that for all our technological advances, the nature of conscious experience remains one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in science.\nThe Intersection of Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence\nIf the human brain is fascinating, the emerging relationship between neuroscience and artificial intelligence is nothing short of mind-blowing. As someone who straddles both worlds, I’ve watched with equal parts excitement and existential wonder as AI technologies begin to mirror—and in some ways challenge—our understanding of intelligence.\nNeural networks in AI are literally named after biological neural networks, and the parallels are both remarkable and humbling. Just as our brains learn through connecting and strengthening neural pathways, machine learning algorithms adapt and improve through iterative processes. But here’s where it gets really interesting: while AI can now perform specific tasks with superhuman precision, it still lacks the holistic, contextual understanding that comes so naturally to the human brain.\nTake neural networks, for instance. They’re inspired by our brain’s structure, with layers of computational “neurons” that process and transmit information. But unlike our brains, which can seamlessly integrate emotion, context, creativity, and logic, AI systems remain fundamentally pattern-recognition machines. They can beat us at chess, diagnose diseases with incredible accuracy, and generate stunning art—but they can’t truly understand the emotional nuance behind a brushstroke or the existential weight of a checkmate.\n(Fun brain fact: While an AI might process millions of data points in seconds, your brain is doing something far more complex—it’s not just processing information, it’s creating meaning, generating emotions, and weaving narratives in real-time. Take that, supercomputers!)\nThe most exciting frontier is perhaps brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), where neuroscience and AI converge. Imagine technologies that could help paralyzed individuals control prosthetic limbs with their thoughts, or assist people with communication disorders by directly translating neural signals into speech or text. We’re not just talking about assistive technology—we’re talking about fundamentally expanding human potential.\nBut with great potential comes great responsibility. As AI systems become more sophisticated, we must carefully consider the ethical implications. How do we ensure these technologies enhance human capabilities without replacing human connection? How do we prevent algorithmic biases that might perpetuate existing social inequalities? These are not just technological questions—they’re deeply human ones.\nMy journey through neuroscience and psychology has taught me one fundamental lesson: the more we learn, the more we realize how much we don’t know. The human brain remains an endless source of wonder, a complex universe waiting to be explored.\nTo all aspiring neuroscientists and psychologists out there: embrace the mystery, stay curious, and never stop asking questions. The most exciting discoveries are yet to come.\nNote: This blog post is a personal reflection and represents the ongoing exploration of neuroscientific knowledge.
