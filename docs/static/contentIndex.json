{"Neuroscience-and-AI":{"title":"Neuroscience and AI","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"I was lately giving a lot of thought to where and when the next super huge invention will happen. It is not news that the next 1905 will be somewhere between 2025 and 2030, where people will discover AGI. The big difference here is that AGI will not be discovered as a breakthrough but as a result of gradual improvements in the current AI systems.\nAs our AI systems develop, they will be the ones who create the breakthroughs and transform our lives. But there is one arena where AI is not contemplated very much, yet plays a big role in the creation and development of modern AI systems. The arena I am talking about is Neuroscience.\nOur body is a product of millions of years of evolution, and one of the most awesome products of evolution is the human brain. Think about it for a minute: our brain works at extremely low power, learns new concepts pretty fast, stores a whole lot of information, runs the whole body, and weighs only 1.4 kilograms. Even though all the modern AI systems are very much motivated by the brain, we are still scratching the surface.\nIf you are someone who wants to learn more about how the brain works and what we know about the mathematics of the brain, then this blog is for you.\nBiological Neural Networks: A Computational Paradigm\nAt the core of neuroscience-inspired artificial intelligence lies the intricate structure of biological neural networks.\nIf your brain had a twitter bio, its would read “Multi-tasking Expert, Parallel Processing Ninja, and Professional Signal Interpreter”.\nA biological neuron is not a simple binary switch, but a complex computational unit characterized by following features\n\n\nStructural Complexity\n\nDendritic arbor: A branching network of input receivers\nSoma: The cell body that integrates multiple input signals\nAxon: The signal transmission pathway\nSynaptic terminals: Points of inter neuronal communication\n\n\n\nSignal Processing Mechanisms\n\nMembrane Potential Dynamics: Neurons process information through graded electrical potentials\nThreshold based Activation: Action potentials are generated when membrane potential exceeds a critical threshold\nSpike timing dependent Plasticity (STDP): A learning mechanism where the timing of neuronal spikes determines synaptic weight modifications\n\n\n\nComputational Neural Network Architectures\nArtificial Neuron Model: Mathematical Formalization\nThe artificial neuron, inspired by biological counterparts, can be represented mathematically:\ny = f\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i + b\\right)\nWhere:\n\ny: Output of the neuron\nx_i: Input signals\nw_i: Synaptic weights\nb: Bias term\nf(): Activation function (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid, tanh)\n\nKey Neural Network Paradigms\n\n\nFeedforward Neural Networks\n\nUnidirectional information flow\nTypically used for classification and regression tasks\nLack recurrent connections found in biological systems\n\n\n\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)\n\nIncorporate feedback loops\nMaintain internal state (memory)\nArchitectures like LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) more closely mimic neuronal temporal dynamics\n\n\n\nSpiking Neural Networks (SNNs)\n\nMost biologically faithful neural network model\nDiscrete event based computation\nUse spike timing based information processing\nComputational model closer to biological neural networks\n\n\n\nYou can learn about all these by simply googling or asking your AI Chatbot.\nAdvanced Neuromorphic Principles\nNeuroplasticity Algorithms\nBiological learning is fundamentally about synaptic weight modification. Computational analogues include:\n\n\nHebbian Learning\n\\Delta w_{ij} = \\eta \\cdot x_i \\cdot y_j\nWhere \\eta represents the learning rate, demonstrating how correlated preand post synaptic activities modify synaptic strength\n\n\nBackpropagation\n\nGradient based learning algorithm\nCalculates error gradients and propagates them backward through the network\nMathematically represented as:\n\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial w} = \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial y} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial w}\n\n\n\nStochastic Neural Computation\nBiological neurons exhibit inherent noise and probabilistic signaling.
