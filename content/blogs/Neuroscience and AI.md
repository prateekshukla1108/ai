I was lately giving a lot of thought to where and when the next super huge invention will happen. It is not news that the next 1905 will be somewhere between 2025 and 2030, where people will discover AGI. The big difference here is that AGI will not be discovered as a breakthrough but as a result of gradual improvements in the current AI systems.

As our AI systems develop, they will be the ones who create the breakthroughs and transform our lives. But there is one arena where AI is not contemplated very much, yet plays a big role in the creation and development of modern AI systems. The arena I am talking about is Neuroscience.

Our body is a product of millions of years of evolution, and one of the most awesome products of evolution is the human brain. Think about it for a minute: our brain works at extremely low power, learns new concepts pretty fast, stores a whole lot of information, runs the whole body, and weighs only 1.4 kilograms. Even though all the modern AI systems are very much motivated by the brain, we are still scratching the surface.

If you are someone who wants to learn more about how the brain works and what we know about the mathematics of the brain, then this blog is for you.

## Biological Neural Networks: A Computational Paradigm

At the core of neuroscience-inspired artificial intelligence lies the intricate structure of biological neural networks. 

*If your brain had a twitter bio, its would read "Multi-tasking Expert, Parallel Processing Ninja, and Professional Signal Interpreter".*

A biological neuron is not a simple binary switch, but a complex computational unit characterized by following features


1. **Structural Complexity**
   - Dendritic arbor: A branching network of input receivers
   - Soma: The cell body that integrates multiple input signals
   - Axon: The signal transmission pathway
   - Synaptic terminals: Points of inter neuronal communication

2. **Signal Processing Mechanisms**
   - **Membrane Potential Dynamics**: Neurons process information through graded electrical potentials
   - **Threshold based Activation**: Action potentials are generated when membrane potential exceeds a critical threshold
   - **Spike timing dependent Plasticity (STDP)**: A learning mechanism where the timing of neuronal spikes determines synaptic weight modifications

## Computational Neural Network Architectures

### Artificial Neuron Model: Mathematical Formalization

The artificial neuron, inspired by biological counterparts, can be represented mathematically:

$$
y = f\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i + b\right)
$$

Where:
- $$y$$: Output of the neuron
- $$x_i$$: Input signals
- $$w_i$$: Synaptic weights
- $$b$$: Bias term
- $$f()$$: Activation function (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid, tanh)

### Key Neural Network Paradigms

1. **Feedforward Neural Networks**
   - Unidirectional information flow
   - Typically used for classification and regression tasks
   - Lack recurrent connections found in biological systems

2. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**
   - Incorporate feedback loops
   - Maintain internal state (memory)
   - Architectures like LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) more closely mimic neuronal temporal dynamics

3. **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)**
   - Most biologically faithful neural network model
   - Discrete event based computation
   - Use spike timing based information processing
   - Computational model closer to biological neural networks

You can learn about all these by simply googling or asking your AI Chatbot.
## Advanced Neuromorphic Principles

### Neuroplasticity Algorithms

Biological learning is fundamentally about synaptic weight modification. Computational analogues include:

1. **Hebbian Learning**
   $$\Delta w_{ij} = \eta \cdot x_i \cdot y_j$$
   Where $$\eta$$ represents the learning rate, demonstrating how correlated preand post synaptic activities modify synaptic strength

2. **Backpropagation**
   - Gradient based learning algorithm
   - Calculates error gradients and propagates them backward through the network
   - Mathematically represented as:
     $$\frac{\partial E}{\partial w} = \frac{\partial E}{\partial y} \cdot \frac{\partial y}{\partial w}$$

### Stochastic Neural Computation

Biological neurons exhibit inherent noise and probabilistic signaling. Modern AI architectures incorporate similar principles:

- Dropout layers: Probabilistic neuron deactivation
- Bayesian neural networks: Probabilistic weight representations
- Monte Carlo dropout: Approximating weight uncertainty

## Computational Neuroscience Metrics

### Information Theoretic Perspectives

1. **Mutual Information**
   Quantifies the statistical dependency between neuronal inputs and outputs
   $$I(X;Y) = \sum_{x,y} p(x,y) \log\left(\frac{p(x,y)}{p(x)p(y)}\right)$$

2. **Entropy based Network Efficiency**
   Measures the information processing capacity of neural networks

## Emerging Research Frontiers

1. **Neuromorphic Hardware**
   - Specialized chips mimicking neural computation
   - Event driven processing
   - Low power consumption architectures

2. **Hybrid Biological Artificial Interfaces**
   - Brain computer interfaces
   - Neuronal culture based computational substrates

## Theoretical Limitations and Challenges

- Biological neural networks operate at $$10^{-3}$$ energy efficiency compared to current computational models
- Challenges in fully replicating biological learning mechanisms
- Quantum level interactions not yet fully understood or modeled

## Conclusion: A Convergent Computational Paradigm

The intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence represents a profound computational frontier. *Warning: Continued research may result in AI that not only understands your jokes but might actually develop the ability to roast you back.*

By understanding and mathematically modeling biological neural mechanisms, we're developing increasingly sophisticated computational systems that more closely approximate biological intelligence.
